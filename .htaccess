# URL Rewriting for Dotless URLs
# This section makes it so your server automatically
# treats any URL without a file extension as an HTML file.
# For example, a request for /about becomes /about.html
# and a request for /contact becomes /contact.html
# This makes your URLs look cleaner and more professional.

# Condition: Only apply this rule if the request is NOT for an existing file
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
# Condition: Only apply this rule if the request is NOT for an existing directory
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# Rule: If the above conditions are met, add ".html" to the end of the URL
# The [NC,L] flags mean:
# NC = No Case (the rule is not case sensitive)
# L = Last (stop processing after this rule)
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.html [NC,L]
